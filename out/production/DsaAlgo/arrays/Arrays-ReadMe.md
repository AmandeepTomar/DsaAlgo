## Arrays

- An array is a collection of items of same data type stored at contiguous memory locations.
- for example int arr[]={1,2,3,4,5} , it is an int type array that have 5 element or length is 5. Index is started from
  0 and goes to length-1;
- All the elements in the array are next to each other in terms of memory cells. for example if arr[0] is stored in
  200th index in memory than it will be stored all other elements in 201,202,203 and 204. No gap in between.
- We only insert same type of data. like we can not store string into integer array.
- We can not changed the size of array once initialized.
